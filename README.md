### Abstract
In this paper, we explore the shortcomings of current audit models and present the Diverge-Converge Multi-Phase Audit (DC MPA), a novel approach aimed at boosting the quality and efficiency of audits in the Web3 sphere.

Our proposed audit model is structured into four essential distinct phases: a traditional audit conducted by a lead (personal auditor or a team of auditors or an audit firm), a public epochal time-boxed bug bounty (PET bug bounty), an exclusive competition, and a final review. Additional phases can be added according to the protocol's preference.

It is worth noting that the new model differs from a simple combination of several single-phase audits. A unique feature of this model is how each phase is interlinked with incentives and disincentives, fostering a spirit of rigorous competition amongst auditors.

Being the first model of its kind to incorporate multiple distinct phases of auditing, we anticipate that it will offer high-quality audits and foresee its wide adoption in the Web3 space.
